# Airline-Pass-Satisfaction-Project
An Airline company has started to release their new coupon campaign which target the airline passenger.

The Airline company has recently taken feedback from their 25976 customers(passengers) to know how much they enjoy the airline services. After looking at the feedback of their customers satisfaction survey and the tough market competition, to increase the customer retention rate they have decided to start the coupon campaign for the customers who are satisfied with the airline services.

Out of 25975, 11402 passengers were satisfied with the airline services. Looking at this airline team gave $45 discount coupon on the tickets for the passengers who were satisfied to make them a regular customer and retain them. After the coupon campaign was over they came to know that they actually made a severe loss which ultimatley resulted them in paying the amount from their own pockets. 

To avoid the same in the future, they asked USF-DSP students to help them develop a model to identify among satisfied customers whom should be given the discount coupons. They have shared the details that retaining a new customer into the airline will profit them \\$100 per customer and loosing the customer will cost them loss of $45 per customers. They have an additional 50,000 passengers waiting for the discount coupons.
